A sample of 15 products shows that cephalopod preparations contain between 30 and 60% (average 48%) meat. The CF for squid tubes is 1,69 (as in 0307 41 91), CF for cattlefish stripes is 1,98 (0307 41 10). The average of the two is 1,84, which gives 1,84*48%=0,88. But this item also includes scallop preparation. A sample of 16 products show that the preparations contain on average 37% of scallop meat for with CF 8,66 has been identified, which gives CF 3,2. This item also includes prepared snails which are not sea products but which have a significant trade. By assuming that cephalopods scallops and snails represent 1/3 of the trade each, it is proposed an average CF 1,36  (source: Oceanic Developpement survey).",1.36
